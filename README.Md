# 3D Model Viewer

A cross-platform desktop application for viewing 3D models and point clouds using PyQt5 and VTK.

## Features

- **Supported Formats:**  
  - Mesh: `.stl`, `.obj`, `.ply`
  - Point Cloud: `.las`, `.e57`
- **Material & Texture Support:**  
  - Loads OBJ materials (`.mtl`) and textures.
- **Lighting Presets:**  
  - Choose between Default, Studio, and Off.
  - Cycle presets with the `L` key.
  - **Interactive Light Adjustment:** Change light positions, colors, and intensities via a dialog.
- **Wireframe Toggle:**  
  - Toggle wireframe mode with the `W` key.
- **Camera Controls:**  
  - Automatic centering and zoom for loaded models.
- **Point Cloud Visualization:**  
  - LAS and E57 files display colored points if color data is present.
- **Outline Box:**  
  - Point clouds are shown with a bounding box for context.
- **Status Bar:**  
  - Displays current lighting preset and material info.


## üèÅ Prerequisites
Here's how to run your Python-based 3D model viewer project step by step:

Make sure you have the following installed:
‚Ä¢ 	Python 3.8+
‚Ä¢ 	pip (Python package manager)
‚Ä¢ 	A code editor like VS Code or PyCharm

## üì¶ Installation of required libraries
Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
pip install PyQt5 vtk laspy numpy pye57 PyWavefront trimesh
```
or
```sh
    pip install PyQt5 vtk laspy numpy pye57 PyWavefront trimesh
```
This installs:
- PyQt5 for the GUI
- vtk for 3D rendering
- along with some other things for different file format handling

## üß™ Usage
Place a compatible file in the  folder. you can get one from...
https://science.nasa.gov/3d-resources/
https://www.thingiverse.com/

1. **Run the main python file:**
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
    Run the desktop app from the terminal similar to below i.e
```bash
python main.py
```

- This will launch a desktop window with a default 3D model loaded
- Use the mouse to rotate, zoom, and pan the model
- If nothing shows up, make sure the file path is correct and the model isn't empty

2. **Open a model:**  
   Use `File > Open Model` to load a supported file.
3. **Lighting:**  
   Use `View > Lighting: Default/Studio/Off` or press `L` to cycle.
4. **Adjust Lights:**  
   Use `View > Adjust Lights` to interactively change light properties.
5. **Wireframe:**  
   Use `View > Toggle Wireframe` or press `W` to toggle wireframe mode.

## File Format Details
- **OBJ:** Loads associated `.mtl` and texture files if present.
- **PLY:** Supports mesh and point cloud data.
- **LAS/E57:** Displays colored point clouds if color info is available.

## Customization

- **Lighting:**  
  - Adjust via the dialog for position, color, and intensity.
- **Background:**  
  - Default is light gray; change in code if desired.

## Measuring distance
Select "Measure Distance" from the menu.
Click multiple points (left mouse button).
Each measured point will be marked with a green sphere.
Lines are drawn between points; segment and total length are shown in the status bar.
Right-click to finish and see the total path length.
Users can select "Clear Measurements" from the menu to remove all measurement markers and lines.

## Troubleshooting
üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Tips
- If you see errors about missing modules, ensure all dependencies are installed.
- For large point clouds, performance may vary depending on your hardware.
- If the window opens but no model appears, check the console for errors
- If PyQt5 or VTK fails to install, try upgrading pip:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

## üìÅ Files
Inside 3d_model_viewer are...
- `main.py` ‚Äî the entry point
- `viewer.py` ‚Äî the viewer logic
- `assets/` ‚Äî store your 3D models and textures here
